# Audiocracy
Audiocracy is prototype of a basic web application that creates a Spotify playlist based on multiple song suggestions from various users at a social gathering. Rather than adding exactly what users want to the playlist, it adds similar songs (determined by Echo Nest database) in order to aide in music discovery, while still maintaining the desired atmosphere. The website is intended to be accessed on a mobile device, so users can easily and casually request songs while socializing.

Future iterations of the project include separating the playlist from the guest page (it should only be viewed by the host), updating the playlist in real time, seeding a playlist with more than five songs (limitation of Echo Nest API), being able to upvote or downvote the current song (and having that affect the current playlist).

Current bugs: certain songs won't add to the playlist.

Audiocracy was created at WHACK 2016 at Wellesley College by Galen Chuang, Bianca Morris, and Julia Han. We used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Echo Nest API.
